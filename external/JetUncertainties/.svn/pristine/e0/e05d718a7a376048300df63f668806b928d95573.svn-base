2012-10-18 S. Schramm : trunk and JetUncertainties-00-07-04

        * Modified reduction scripts to support reduction by category (config and root files will follow after naming conventions are agreed upon, but they now exist)
2012-11-02 S. Schramm : trunk

2012-11-13 S. Schramm, B. Malaescu, C. Doglioni, D. Gillberg : trunk
	* Re-ran the reduction for all scenarios after much discussion with the above listed people
        * Reduction is run between 17 GeV and 1 TeV
        * Then, this is held constant down to 15 GeV and up to 2.5 TeV
        * Global reduction uses 983 1-GeV bins (then put in standard 100 log bin JES histo)
        * Category reduction uses 983 log-sized bins (then put in standard 100 log bin JES histo)
        * Also added many new scripts relating to creating reduction validation plots
2012-11-20 S. Schramm, B. Malaescu, C. Doglioni, D. Gillberg : trunk
        * In view of the large eta correlation differences when considering eta intercalibration as one vs two parameters:
        *   Removed all reduced config files (except 11NP for backwards support, but it will no longer be recommended)
        *   Added new reduced config files where the two eta intercalibration parameters are split (so 11NP is now 12NP, for example)
        *   These new config files are what will be recommended for use
        *   Hopefully we will get back to 11NP and the like by implementing a 2D reduction method in the future
        * Also changed the provider's binning checking method to only require the same phase space coverage (not identical bins)
2012-11-20 S. Schramm : JetUncertainties-00-07-06
        * Global reductions added for alternative correlations (StrongerCorrelations and WeakerCorrelations)
        * Category reductions added for all scenarios (normal, stronger, and weaker)
        * EtaIntercalibration has been split from a single component to two components, in order to better represent eta correlations
        * Other smaller tweaks have been made (see previous entries between the 00-07-05 tag and this tag)

2013-01-07 S. Schramm : trunk 
        * Updated an error message to force unsigned values (for architecutres where size_t and unsigned are not the same)
        * Some additions and minor changes to JESUtils (clearer names, for example)
2013-01-20 S. Schramm : trunk 
        * Added hasWellKnownCorrelations() method for JESUncertaintyProvider (recommendation on whether or not to profile on a parameter)
        * Many changes to support new 2012 insitu components (and backwards compatible with both 2011 and 2012 HCP)
        * Works on quick tests with 2011 configs/root files, but NOT for release yet!  Still needs more validation
        * New 2012 config/root files not yet added
        * Significantly rearranged JESUncertaintyProvider.* files to make more readable and to group similar methods
        * Again, THIS IS NOT FOR USE BY NON-EXPERTS!  Intermediate commit for joint testing purposes!

        * New Moriond2013 folder has many changes to the components, and has a corresponding 15NP reduction
        * Moriond2013 In-situ uncertainties in $SVNPERF/CombPerf/JetETMiss/JetUncertaintyTools/InsituCombination_2012dataset
        * Still not a tag yet - validation will happen shortly, then a tag will be made, but this is intended to be stable

        * Adjusted Zjet_Extrapolation for LC6 in addition to LC4
        * As a result, re-did reductions
        * Changed reduction config file names to actually match the number of NPs instead of being one off
2013-02-02 S. Schramm : trunk
        * Removed double allocation of gluon fraction uncertainty histogram (memory leak)
        * Added better boundary control for multijet components (>= instead of >)
2013-02-04 S. Schramm : JetUncertainties-00-08-02
        * Making a tag of the fix for multijet boundary control committed two days ago
2013-02-14 S. Schramm, A. Davison : trunk and JetUncertainties-00-08-03
        * Added latest updates to UnusualJetUncertaintyProvider and new 2012 uncertainties from Adam Davison
        * Fixed pileup offset for Final 2011 configurations
        * Changed all EqualTo() instances to CompareTo() for supporting old ROOT versions
2013-02-18 S. Schramm : trunk and JetUncertainties-00-08-04
        * Fixed a bug when fCloseby >= 1.5
2013-02-19 S. Schramm : trunk and JetUncertainties-00-08-05
        * Fixed a bug introduced in the previous tag for 2011 and HCP2012 analyses
2013-03-11 S. Schramm : trunk
        * Switched getComponentIndex() to public
2013-03-27 S. Schramm : trunk
        * Large changes to nJet flavour composition treatment following input from Will Bell
2013-03-28 S. Schramm : trunk
        * A few more error checks for the nJet terms, thanks to Will Bell
2013-04-11 S. Schramm : trunk
        * Changed CloseBy uncertainty to support MC type dependence
        * Changed MC12a/Pythia8 in Moriond2013 configuration to have zero uncertainty
        * Changed AFII in Moriond2013 configuration to have the old uncertainty, pending further updates
2013-04-17 S. Schramm : trunk and JetUncertainties-00-08-06
        * AFII uncertainty is now also zero for Moriond2013 configurations
        * Creating tag now with these changes following approval discussion on April 17 Jet/EtMiss meeting
